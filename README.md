# Cosmetics Safety Scanner — **Detect Harmful Ingredients from Images**

This project helps you quickly check whether a cosmetic product may contain **harmful or sensitive ingredients**.  
Upload a **photo of the ingredient list** and the system will scan it for potential concerns.

---

## What It Does

- **Upload a product image** → the backend reads the text using **OCR** (Optical Character Recognition).  
- The detected text is checked against **rules** for known allergens, preservatives, UV filters, alcohols, and controversial additives.  
- (Optional) An **AI model** (GPT) gives a short, user-friendly summary of the safety profile.  
- Results are returned in a **clear, structured JSON format**, and displayed nicely in the Lovable frontend.

## How It Works (in simple terms)

### Frontend (Lovable)
- Clean interface where you upload an image.  
- Shows analysis results in an easy-to-read way.  

### Backend (FastAPI + Python)
- **OCR**: Reads text from the photo. Uses Tesseract (default) and optionally Hugging Face TrOCR.  
- **Rules engine**: Flags keywords like **PEG/PPG**, **Homosalate**, **Phenoxyethanol**, or **Fragrance**.  
- **Optional GPT**: Summarizes findings into short, plain-language safety notes.  
- **Fallbacks**: If AI fails or isn’t enabled, rules-only results are always provided.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Requirements
- Python **3.10+**
- Tesseract OCR installed on your system  
  *(example: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr` on Ubuntu)*

Install Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 2. Run the API
uvicorn app:app --reload

### 3. Use the Lovable front end
The Lovable app connects to this backend. Upload an image of an ingredient list and click “Analyze for Harmful Content”.

Example result
{
  "ocr_text_corrected": "Ingredients: Water, Homosalate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance",
  "rules_flags": {
    "allergens": ["fragrance/parfum"],
    "problematic_additives": ["PEG/PPG", "homosalate", "phenoxyethanol"]
  },
  "analysis": {
    "safe_overall": true,
    "reasons": [
      "Includes homosalate (UV filter); restricted in some regions and may irritate sensitive skin.",
      "Contains PEG/PPG surfactants which some users avoid.",
      "Uses phenoxyethanol as a preservative; generally safe at low % but can irritate sensitive skin."
    ],
    "advise": "Review label; re-upload a clearer photo if OCR looks wrong."
  }
}

**Why This Matters**

- Many people are sensitive to fragrance, preservatives, or UV filters.
- Ingredient lists are often long and hard to parse.
- This tool highlights the main potential concerns automatically, giving you quick peace of mind.

**Future Ideas**

Personalization basis user allergies or other health conditions
Highlight flagged ingredients directly in the UI
Add more region-specific ingredient restrictions
Improve OCR on low-quality / WhatsApp-compressed images
